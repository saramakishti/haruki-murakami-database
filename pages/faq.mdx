#### How is this website built?

I have used NextJS with Nextra template which serves static pages with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for building this website. However, it is **not** necessary to know a programming language to contribute, all the book references are laid out using simple markdown notations such as tables. Check out the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) if you want to learn how to use it and contribute in adding/fixing references with markdown only.

#### How do I contribute?

Since the codebase of the website is hosted on Github, you will need to have a Github account to be a added as a collaborator. If you are a developer and want to be a collaborator or if you are not a developer but still want to contribute, please get in touch [here](/about).

#### There is a missing reference / Something is wrong with the reference attributed to his book / The external links are not working properly

If you have a Github account already, it is very easy to contribute on this collection by pointing out mistakes on references. The easiest way is to click on the right sidebar of the page at the `Question? Give us feedback` link.

You will be directed to the _Issues_ section of the repository on Github, where you can simply describe the issue you are facing on the page you are viewing and I will be responding shortly to your query.
