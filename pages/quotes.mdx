## Hear the Wind Sing

> There's no such thing as perfect writing, just like there's no such thing as perfect despair.

> All the same, writing honestly is very difficult. The more I try to be honest, the farther my words sink into darkness.

> Ascribing meaning to life is a piece of cake compared to actually living it.

> I kept asking myself, how could you just float there not doing anything when I was suffering?

## Pinball (1973)

> The world awaiting him out there was just too big, too powerful; there seemed to be no place where he could burrow into it.

> My face and my soul were lifeless shells, of no significance to anyone.

> Now I had a rare moment alone, and I still couldn't get a handle on how to deal with myself.

> All we can perceive is this moment we call the present, and even this moment is nothing more than what passes through us.

> Pinball leads to nowhere. The only result is a glowing replay light. Replay, replay, replay - it makes you think the whole aim of the game is to achieve a form of eternity.

> The goal of pinball is self-transformation, not self-expression.
